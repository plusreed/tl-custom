TSF custom templates I use.
# FAQ
###### Can I use this?
If you aren't in the Telegram Support Force, I don't know how you're going to use this, but sure...? <br />
If you are, however, feel free! You should know how to import templates. If you don't, however, ask your local group. They'd be happy to help, more than likely.
######I'm not part of the TSF, how do I use this?
Short answer is, well, you don't. These probably have no use for you. 
######Can I translate these templates?
Sure! To keep things consistent, the file names are like this: `tl_custom_langcode.txt` It's preferable if you follow this naming scheme, as I want this repository to be neat and tidy (unlike any of my other projects. :P)
######How do I download these templates?
If you want, you can just select the one template you want by opening it from the web interface and clicking "Raw". You can either copy the page and paste it in a text document, or save it using Control + S (Command + S for Mac, respectively). Or, if you want the whole pack, you can download the ZIP by clicking the "Clone or download" dropdown and click "Download ZIP".
######Telegram Support Force? What's that?
When you click the "Ask a question" button in your Telegram client, you're taken to a chat that is run by volunteers. That's the Telegram Support Force, we are a group of volunteers who help Telegram users with Telegram-related questions.
######Sounds cool, where do I sign up?
I dunno. I heard [the FAQ](https://telegram.org/faq) might have something about it.
######Are you in the TSF?
ðŸ¤”
######Hey, I think some responses here are inappropriate for use on the support accounts.
Leave an issue, please. Some things might slip in here that are inappropriate.
######So, the support account isn't run by robots? You're all human?
Beep boop. We are programmed to eradicate the human race and participate in world destruction. (Yeah, we are.)
